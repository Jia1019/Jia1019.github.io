        <p>The analysis of robbery data from San Francisco reveals distinct patterns across different times of day, providing crucial insights for residents and visitors concerned about safety. As shown in our first visualization, robberies follow a predictable daily rhythm that can inform personal safety decisions.</p>

<p><img src="assets\images\SF-Robbery Incidents by Hour od Day(2014-2024).png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The data clearly identifies a high-risk window extending from early afternoon (2:00 PM) through the night until early morning (2:00 AM). Within this period, the most dangerous time occurs at 8:00 PM, when robbery incidents peak at 2,080 cases. This evening surge coincides with several environmental factors that create opportunities for potential offenders: diminished natural light, fewer witnesses on the streets, and people carrying valuables while returning from work or heading to evening activities.</p>

<p>By contrast, early morning hours between 5:00 AM and 7:00 AM represent the safest period, with approximately 600 incidents per hour—less than one-third of the evening peak. This significant drop likely results from minimal pedestrian traffic and the increased visibility that comes with daybreak, deterring would-be robbers.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that the late-night period from midnight to 2:00 AM maintains surprisingly high robbery rates, with over 1,500 incidents per hour. This presents considerable risk to nightlife participants and late-shift workers making their way home when public transit options may be limited and streets less populated.
These temporal patterns suggest practical safety measures: scheduling outings during daylight hours when possible, maintaining heightened awareness after dark (especially around 8:00 PM), traveling in groups during high-risk hours, and considering secure transportation options for late-night travel.</p>

<p>Our next visualization examines where these robberies most frequently occur, complementing the temporal analysis with crucial spatial information.</p>

<p>With only 5,211 cases, mornings (6:00-11:59) represent the safest time period. The first map shows small, isolated clusters primarily in downtown areas, with minimal activity in residential neighborhoods. Even known high-crime areas show significantly reduced risk, with green dots indicating low incident counts (typically under 10 per location) scattered throughout the city.</p>

<p>The afternoon period (12:00-17:59) shows substantially increased activity, with 10,277 cases particularly in commercial districts. The northeastern section intensifies significantly, with major hotspots developing around downtown, the Financial District, and SoMa. The heatmap reveals concentrated clusters with 500+ incidents in these areas, and secondary hotspots extending into the Mission District. Numbers like 2,168, 1,233, and 702 indicate extraordinarily high-risk zones that correlate with commercial and tourist activities.</p>

<p>Evening hours (18:00-23:59) represent the highest risk timeframe with 11,505 cases. The map shows the most intense concentration patterns, with dramatic hotspots in downtown and entertainment districts. Some locations record staggering numbers—2,850 robberies in a single area—while the heat signature extends further into residential neighborhoods than during any other period. The red heatmap coloration intensifies and covers broader areas, particularly along transit corridors and nightlife districts.</p>

<p>During late night hours (00:00-5:59), the pattern shifts again with 6,994 cases. The downtown core remains dangerous (with locations showing 2,301 incidents), but activity in residential areas diminishes significantly. The purple coloration dominates outer neighborhoods, indicating lower risk, while the northeastern section of the city remains a concentrated danger zone with intensely yellow and red hotspots.</p>

<p>This temporal analysis reveals how robbery risk isn’t static but shifts dramatically throughout the day. While certain areas—particularly downtown, the Tenderloin, and parts of SoMa—remain dangerous across all time periods, the intensity and geographic spread vary significantly. For residents and visitors, understanding these patterns provides crucial information for making safer choices about when and where to navigate different parts of San Francisco.</p>

<p>This heatmap in Bokeh provides a multidimensional analysis of robbery patterns in San Francisco, segmented by hour-of-day (x-axis) against three temporal dimensions: day of week, month, and year (y-axis). The visualization shows that lighter colors mean fewer robberies, while darker red spots show where and when robberies happen most often. This lets us spot clear patterns about when crimes are more likely to occur.</p>

<p>On weekdays (Monday-Friday), robberies start increasing around 13:00 PM, peak at 14:00 PM, and stay high until about 00:00 AM. Weekends are worse - Saturday and Sunday nights are especially dangerous, with the highest number of robberies happening between midnight and 2:00 AM. </p>
  
<p>The winter months (November through January) show the highest overall robbery frequencies, particularly during evening hours. January stands out with exceptionally high counts between 6:00 PM and midnight, likely tied to holiday shopping and celebrations. During summer months (June through August), while daytime robberies decrease slightly, nighttime incidents (9:00 PM to 2:00 AM) remain elevated, possibly due to increased outdoor social activity. Spring months (March through May) demonstrate the most stable patterns, with relatively consistent robbery rates throughout the day.</p>

<p>Robbery incidents steadily increased from 2014 to 2017, with the high-risk evening period extending over more hours. The peak years were 2018 and 2019, with 2018 standing out due to consistently high robbery rates, especially between 11:00 AM and 3:00 AM—these incidents were more frequent than in any other year. During the pandemic (2020-2021), overall robbery numbers declined significantly, with the lowest counts recorded in the early morning hours. Since 2022, robbery patterns have largely returned to pre-pandemic trends, though both the afternoon and evening hours remain particularly risky.</p>

<p>Overall, the analysis highlights clear patterns in San Francisco's robbery trends, influenced by time of day, season, and long-term changes. Evenings and late nights remain the most dangerous periods, with peak risks in commercial and downtown areas. While crime rates surged in 2018-2019, they declined during the pandemic before partially rebounding in recent years. Understanding these trends allows individuals to take informed precautions, such as avoiding high-risk areas at night and staying vigilant during winter months. By recognizing when and where robberies are most likely to occur, residents and visitors can make safer choices and reduce their exposure to crime.</p>
