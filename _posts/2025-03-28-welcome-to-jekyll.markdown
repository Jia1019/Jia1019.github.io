The analysis of robbery data from San Francisco reveals distinct patterns across different times of day, providing crucial insights for residents and visitors concerned about safety. As shown in our first visualization, robberies follow a predictable daily rhythm that can inform personal safety decisions.

The data clearly identifies a high-risk window extending from early afternoon (2:00 PM) through the night until early morning (2:00 AM). Within this period, the most dangerous time occurs at 8:00 PM, when robbery incidents peak at 2,080 cases. This evening surge coincides with several environmental factors that create opportunities for potential offenders: diminished natural light, fewer witnesses on the streets, and people carrying valuables while returning from work or heading to evening activities.

By contrast, early morning hours between 5:00 AM and 7:00 AM represent the safest period, with approximately 600 incidents per hourâ€”less than one-third of the evening peak. This significant drop likely results from minimal pedestrian traffic and the increased visibility that comes with daybreak, deterring would-be robbers.

It's worth noting that the late-night period from midnight to 2:00 AM maintains surprisingly high robbery rates, with over 1,500 incidents per hour. This presents considerable risk to nightlife participants and late-shift workers making their way home when public transit options may be limited and streets less populated.
These temporal patterns suggest practical safety measures: scheduling outings during daylight hours when possible, maintaining heightened awareness after dark (especially around 8:00 PM), traveling in groups during high-risk hours, and considering secure transportation options for late-night travel.

Our next visualization examines where these robberies most frequently occur, complementing the temporal analysis with crucial spatial information.
